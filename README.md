## Yuki's software

Hi! My name is Yuki (or J.P., depending on my current mood), and welcome to my GitHub page :)

*Disclaimer: Most of the repositories here were one-off projects made in a weekend during my free time in order to learn some technologies... I provide almost no support and these come with no guarantees, but it's pretty nice on a resume, just to see how I code and what I like :)*

Note: This account and most of its projects have been moved and migrated to [git.a39.ca/yuki](https://git.a39.ca/yuki). No support is provided anymore on GitHub.
